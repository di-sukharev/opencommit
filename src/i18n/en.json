  "commitFeat": "feat(server.ts): add support for process.env.PORT environment variable",
  "commitDescription": "The port variable is now named PORT, which improves consistency with the naming conventions as PORT is a constant. Support for an environment variable allows the application to be more flexible as it can now run on any available port specified via the process.env.PORT environment variable."
