All the commits in this repo are done with OpenCommit â€” look into [the commits](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit/commit/eae7618d575ee8d2e9fff5de56da79d40c4bc5fc) to see how OpenCommit works. Emoji and long commit description text is configurable.

## Setup OpenCommit as a Github Action ðŸ”¥

OpenCommit is now available as a GitHub Action which automatically improves all new commits messages when you push to remote!

This is great if you want to make sure all of the commits in all of repository branches are meaningful and not lame like `fix1` or `done2`.

Create a file `.github/workflows/opencommit.yml` with contents below:

```yml
name: 'OpenCommit Action'

on:
  push:
    # this list of branches is often enough,
    # but you may still ignore other public branches
    branches-ignore: [main master dev development release]

jobs:
  opencommit:
    name: OpenCommit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: write-all
    steps:
      - name: Setup Node.js Environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: di-sukharev/opencommit@github-action-v1.0.4
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

        env:
          # set openAI api key in repo actions secrets,
          # for openAI keys go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
          # for repo secret go to: <your_repo_url>/settings/secrets/actions
          OCO_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OCO_OPENAI_API_KEY }}

          # customization
          OCO_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS: 500
          OCO_OPENAI_BASE_PATH: ''
          OCO_DESCRIPTION: false
          OCO_EMOJI: false
          OCO_MODEL: gpt-3.5-turbo
          OCO_LANGUAGE: en
```

That is it. Now when you push to any branch in your repo â€” all NEW commits are being improved by never-tired-AI.

Make sure you exclude public collaboration branches (`main`, `dev`, `etc`) in `branches-ignore`, so OpenCommit does not rebase commits there when improving the messages.

Interactive rebase (`rebase -i`) changes commit SHA, so commit history in remote becomes different with your local branch history. It's ok when you work on the branch alone, but may be inconvenient for other collaborators.

## Setup OpenCommit as a CLI

You can use OpenCommit by simply running it via CLI like this `oc`. 2 seconds and your staged changes are committed with a meaningful message.

1. Install OpenCommit globally to use in any repository:

   ```sh
   npm install -g opencommit
   ```

2. Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Make sure you add payment details, so API works.

3. Set the key to OpenCommit config:

   ```sh
   opencommit config set OCO_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

   Your api key is stored locally in `~/.opencommit` config file.

## Usage

You can call OpenCommit directly to generate a commit message for your staged changes:

```sh
git add <files...>
opencommit
```

You can also use the `oc` shortcut:

```sh
git add <files...>
oc
```

## Configuration

### Local per repo configuration

Create an `.env` file and add OpenCommit config variables there like this:

```env
OCO_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openAI API token>
OCO_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=<max response tokens from openAI API>
OCO_OPENAI_BASE_PATH=<may be used to set proxy path to openAI api>
OCO_DESCRIPTION=<postface a message with ~3 sentences description>
OCO_EMOJI=<add GitMoji>
OCO_MODEL=<either gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4>
OCO_LANGUAGE=<locale, scroll to the bottom to see options>
```

### Global config for all repos

Local config still has more priority as Global config, but you may set `OCO_MODEL` and `OCO_LOCALE` globally and set local configs for `OCO_EMOJI` and `OCO_DESCRIPTION` per repo which is more convenient.

Simply run any of the variable above like this:

```sh
oc config set OCO_OPENAI_API_KEY=gpt-4
```

Configure [GitMoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) to preface a message.

```sh
oc config set OCO_EMOJI=true
```

To remove preface emoji:

```sh
oc config set OCO_EMOJI=false
```

### Switch to GPT-4

By default OpenCommit uses GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT).

You may switch to GPT-4 which performs better, but costs ~x15 times more ðŸ¤ 

```sh
oc config set OCO_MODEL=gpt-4
```

Make sure you do lowercase `gpt-4` and you have API access to the 4th model. Even if you have ChatGPT+ it doesn't necessarily mean that you have API access to GPT-4.

## Locale configuration

To globally specify the language used to generate commit messages:

```sh
# de, German ,Deutsch
oc config set OCO_LANGUAGE=de
oc config set OCO_LANGUAGE=German
oc config set OCO_LANGUAGE=Deutsch

# fr, French, franÃ§aise
oc config set OCO_LANGUAGE=fr
oc config set OCO_LANGUAGE=French
oc config set OCO_LANGUAGE=franÃ§aise
```

The default language set is **English**  
All available languages are currently listed in the [i18n](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit/tree/master/src/i18n) folder

### Git flags

The `opencommit` or `oc` commands can be used in place of the `git commit -m "${generatedMessage}"` command. This means that any regular flags that are used with the `git commit` command will also be applied when using `opencommit` or `oc`.

```sh
oc --no-verify
```

is translated to :

```sh
git commit -m "${generatedMessage}" --no-verify
```

### Ignore files

You can ignore files from submission to OpenAI by creating a `.opencommitignore` file. For example:

```ignorelang
path/to/large-asset.zip
**/*.jpg
```

This is useful for preventing opencommit from uploading artifacts and large files.

By default, opencommit ignores files matching: `*-lock.*` and `*.lock`

## Git hook (KILLER FEATURE)

You can set OpenCommit as Git [`prepare-commit-msg`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) hook. Hook integrates with you IDE Source Control and allows you edit the message before commit.

To set the hook:

```sh
oc hook set
```

To unset the hook:

```sh
oc hook unset
```

To use the hook:

```sh
git add <files...>
git commit
```

Or follow the process of your IDE Source Control feature, when it calls `git commit` command â€” OpenCommit will integrate into the flow.

## Payments

You pay for your own requests to OpenAI API. OpenCommit uses ChatGPT (3.5-turbo) official model, that is ~15x times cheaper than GPT-4.
